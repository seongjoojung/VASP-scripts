`ionic_permittivity.py`: Calculates normal mode charges, mode oscillator strengths and ionic contribution to permittivity ([read more](https://seongjoojung.github.io/posts/nmc-mos-icd/))

`polarization.py`: Calculate the Berry phase polarization, requires input of quantized offset of polarization in each lattice directions. The offset can only be multiples of 0.5

`dos_plot.py`: Plots noncollinear PDOS (s,p,d orbitals) from xml file
